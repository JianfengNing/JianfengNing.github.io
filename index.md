<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, studying under the mentorship of Prof. [Jun Zou](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~zou/). My research involves magnetoelectric ("ME") materials for energy-efficient information technology and "ME" materials for data security in information technology using Multiferroics/Magneto-ionics/Surface charging, with a special focus on the boosting magneto-ionic effect using ion irradiation and implantation.

## Research Interest:

- **Inverse Problems:** SRIM, iradina, SDTrimSP, IMSIL, CORETO, TRIDYN, MARLOWE, RustBCA
- **Machine Learning:** fairness AI, penalization and augmentation methods
- **Numerical PDEs** VCMA, Strain-mediated ME (Magnetoelectric) Effects, Straintronic, iontronic, E-filed induced spin reorientation, SOT.
- **Micro-, Nanofabrication**
- **Neuromorphic Computing** Neuromorphic Sensing and Perception, Hybrid Computing Systems, Brain-Inspired Robotics
